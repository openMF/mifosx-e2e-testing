    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another installment of &lt;em&gt;This Week in Spring&lt;/em&gt;! This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Kansas City, Kansas, hanging out with my pal and Spring Security lead Rob Winch. This week, I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at the local User Group and the Spring User Group, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking to Cerner and a few other large businesses about Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of great stuff to talk about, so let&amp;rsquo;s go to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Boot co-lead Phil Webb &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/02/27/spring-boot-1-2-2-released"&gt;just announced Spring Boot 1.2.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/02/27/spring-boot-1-1-11-released"&gt;Spring Boot 1.1.11&lt;/a&gt;. Both releases are recommended upgrades, and Spring Boot 1.2.2 even includes new support for the Mustache templating library. Nice!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out John Hamm&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/03/03/springone2gx-2014-replay-ravejs-spring-boot-concepts-for-javascript-applications"&gt;SpringOne2GX 2014 talk, introducing Rave.js, which brings Spring Boot-concepts to JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I put together a blog on building &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/03/01/the-portable-cloud-ready-http-session"&gt;applications that use the Servlet HTTP session in a scalable manner and in a portable way - from application server, web server, and cloud - with ease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chris Beams&amp;rsquo;s SpringOne2GX 2014 talk, &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/03/03/springone2gx-2014-replay-the-revolution-will-not-be-centralized"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Revolution will not be Centralized&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now available online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want to learn more about caching in Spring? Check out this replay &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/03/03/springone2gx-2014-replay-caching-with-spring-advanced-topics-and-best-practices"&gt;of Michael Plod&amp;rsquo;s SpringOne2GX 2014 talk introducing advanced caching improvements in Spring framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brian Clozel and Rossen Stoyanchev&amp;rsquo;s SpringOne2GX 2014 talk &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/03/03/springone2gx-2014-replay-resource-handling-in-spring-mvc-4-1"&gt;introducing resource handling in Spring MVC 4.1&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Security lead Rob Winch &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/02/26/spring-security-4-0-0-rc2-released"&gt;just announced Spring Security 4.0 RC2&lt;/a&gt; which includes, among other things, support for websockets! Check it out and try the bits out now!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rob Winch also just announced &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/02/26/spring-security-3-2-6-released"&gt;Spring Security 3.2.6 which improves the Java configuratino and Spring Boot integration&lt;/a&gt;, so check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t specific to Spring, or any tech, per se, but it&amp;rsquo;s inspiring an inspiring at &lt;a href="http://www.cio.com.au/article/569280/machine-learning-used-predict-clinical-response-anti-cancer-drugs/"&gt;how machine learning used to predict clinical response to anti-cancer drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speaking of Rob Winch, and education ninja Ken Kreuger, check out their SpringOne2GX 2014 talk on integration testing, &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/spring-mvc-test-htmlunit"&gt;now available on InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alex Zhitnitsky put together a &lt;a href="http://blog.takipi.com/java-bootstrap-dropwizard-vs-spring-boot/"&gt;nice comparison of Spring Boot and Dropwizard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out these &lt;a href="https://t.co/usPYXAXWT3"&gt;Spring Cloud PaaS connectors for IBM&amp;rsquo;s Bluemix, which is based on Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rahman Usta put together an &lt;a href="https://github.com/rahmanusta/ssh-on-web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; cool demo of a web-based SSH client (with Spring Boot in the backend)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This video demonstrates how &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTR7Y_aHuw"&gt;to use Codeenvy and Spring Boot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern JavaScript frameworks have become quite sophisticated. Unfortunately, they have also become quite complicated. The demos and sample projects for these frameworks look deceptively simple. However, to build and deploy real applications, developers must scaffold, configure, and maintain a tremendous amount of intricate machinery. Until recently, the Java world wasn't very different. Spring Boot finally made it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring Applications that can you can &amp;quot;just run&amp;quot;. Can we do the same for JavaScript? Yes, we can! Introducing RaveJS. Rave eliminates configuration, machinery, and complexity. Stop configuring and tweaking machinery such as file watchers, minifiers, and transpilers just to get to a runnable app. Instead, go from zero to &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; in 30 seconds. In the next 30 seconds, easily add capabilities and frameworks to your application simply by installing *Rave Extensions* and *Rave Starter* packages from npm and Bower, the leading JavaScript package managers. Finally, install additional *Rave Extension* packages to apply your favorite build, deploy, and testing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Speaker: Chris Beams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Data / Integration Track &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides: &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/the-revolution-will-not-be-centralizedhow-to-build-a-blockchain-using-spring-to-develop-a-bitcoinlike-virtual-currency"&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/the-revolution-will-not-be-centralizedhow-to-build-a-blockchain-using-spring-to-develop-a-bitcoinlike-virtual-currency &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive government-run data dragnets. Advertising-based &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; cloud services working against the best interests of their users. Giant, unreadable end user license agreements. It seems that everywhere we turn, the walls are closing in on individual privacy and autonomy. The situation is complex. Out of confusion and frustration, many users have already given up. Common refrains are &amp;quot;privacy is dead&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I've got nothing to hide&amp;quot;. But revolution is in the air. The internet and the web are decentralized by design. Protocols like DNS, SMTP and HTTP assume a network of peers, but during the last 15 years—our adolescence with these technologies—we have unintentionally centralized much of the internet's infrastructure. This hasn't been for nefarious purposes; it's been done out of convenience. Having a GMail account is simply much easier than running your own mail server; storing everything in the cloud is easier than maintaining your own backups. As an unintended consequence, we've made surveillance much easier and made invasive ad-based business models the norm. A growing number of technologists are working to re-decentralize the net in surprising and profound ways. Free software and innovative peer-to-peer networks play an important role in this effort, but what may prove to be the most important tool is a new one: cryptocurrency. With bitcoin, we now have a natively digital money; a cash for the web; a currency that is as decentralized and flexible as the rest of the internet was designed to be. At a glance, bitcoin may look like just another payment option, a fad, or a speculative bubble. On closer inspection, one begins to see that it can enable new business models by facilitating previously impossible economic incentives between peers. Once one grasps the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, one sees that its long-term implications and possibilities are as broad and deep as the internet itself. And just like the internet, bitcoin is not a panacea. It is rife with its own problems and faces its own existential threats. In this talk, Chris Beams will share his findings from over two years of research into bitcoin and related technologies: the promise and the peril; how bitcoin may be able to create the first sustainable business models for the development of free software; how privacy may rise from the dead yet; and why the revolution will not be centralized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Caching is relevant for a wide range of business applications and there is a huge variety of products in the market ranging from easy to adopt local heap based caches to powerful distributed data grids. This talk addresses advanced usage of Spring’s caching abstraction such as integrating a cache provider that is not integrated by the default Spring Package. In addition to that I will also give an overview of the JCache Specification and it’s adoption in the Spring ecosystem. Finally the presentation will also address various best practices for integrating various caching solutions into enterprise grade applications that don’t have the luxury of having &amp;quot;eventual consistency“ as a non-functional requirement. This talk comes with many live demos, some of them are demoed on a distributed cache cluster on Raspberry Pis and Lego Mindstorms robots (running Spring).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the complexity of web and mobile apps increases, so does the importance of ensuring that your client-side resources load and execute in an optimal and efficient manner. Differences in resource loading, transforming, and fingerprinting techniques can have a dramatic impact on performance and caching. These techniques can dictate whether your users have a joyful or frustrating experience. Attend this talk to learn the SpringMVC performance techniques aimed at keeping your users happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#a-framework-for-all-seasons-and-architectures" class="anchor" name="a-framework-for-all-seasons-and-architectures"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A Framework for all Seasons (and Architectures)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring walks an interesting line. It provides a lot of value no matter where you run it, and - because it&amp;rsquo;s built on dependency injection layer - it offers a natural piece of indirection between the underlying layer and the applications that run on top of it. This indirection promotes code portability through decoupling: your application code is ignorant of where the &lt;code&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever) handle it&amp;rsquo;s using comes from, be it a JNDI lookup, environment variables, or a simple new&amp;rsquo;d-up bean provided by Spring. This decoupling and the rich toolbox of features on top of Spring supporting all manner of use cases - batch processing, integration, stream processing, web services, microservices, operations, web applications, security, etc. - have made Spring a logical choice for developers deploying to (sometimes-embedded) web containers like Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty, to application servers like WebSphere and WildFly, and to cloud runtimes like Google App Engine, Heroku, OpenShift, and (my personal favorite these days) Cloud Foundry. This portability is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; what makes it easy to forklift most (reasonably-written!) applications from the application servers into lighter web containers and, ultimately, into the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#the-stateful-fly-in-the-ointment" class="anchor" name="the-stateful-fly-in-the-ointment"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The (Stateful) Fly in the Ointment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;rsquo;s the problem? Why write this blog at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things aren&amp;rsquo;t ideal with applications that use the HTTP session, however. Scaling the HTTP session is where things get, - pardon the HTTP session terminology pun - &lt;em&gt;sticky&lt;/em&gt;. You see there are two things that your application will need to scale the HTTP session: session affinity and session replication. Session affinity (or &lt;em&gt;sticky sessions&lt;/em&gt;) means that requests to a clustered web application will be routed to the node that originally issued the HTTP session cookie. If that application instance should be taken offline, then session replication ensures that the relevant state is available on another node. The client can be routed there seamlessly, retaining all notion of conversational state. It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hard to configure HTTP session replication in the popular containers. Here&amp;rsquo;s the page on setting it up &lt;a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/cluster-howto.html"&gt;with Apache Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; and here&amp;rsquo;s the page on how to set it up with &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.2.3.v20140905/session-clustering-jdbc.html"&gt;Jetty&lt;/a&gt;. Typical session replication strategies involve using multicast networking to notify other nodes in a cluster of state changes. Session affinity and session replication work well in small environments where you only have a few nodes. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re using an embedded web container, configuring the HTTP session replication is yet another thing that needs to be configured in the container, outside of the control of the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#that-rsquo-s-ok-the-cloud-rsquo-ll-fix-it-right" class="anchor" name="that-rsquo-s-ok-the-cloud-rsquo-ll-fix-it-right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s OK, the Cloud&amp;rsquo;ll Fix It, Right?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d think that - if nothing else - this sort of configuration would get easier and more predictable once you move your application to the cloud, but in fact it can be more painful! Multicast networking is a no-no in most cloud environments, including in Amazon Web Services. Even in higher-level, more application-centric Platform-as-a-Service environments like Heroku or Cloud Foundry, session replication hasn&amp;rsquo;t been super easy. Heroku, for example, &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/intro-for-java-developers"&gt;offers no session affinity and no session replication&lt;/a&gt;. This restriction is understandable: besides the restrictions in multicast networking, applications should - as much as possible - minimize server-side state. Remember, Heroku limits your application&amp;rsquo;s RAM to 512MB! This is more than enough if you don&amp;rsquo;t try to treat your spare RAM as a database or persistence tier! Cloud Foundry, for its part, serves larger communities of developers and runs on-premise in various data-centers so it has to be a bit more practical. Pivotal Web Services (which runs &lt;a href="http://cloudfoundry.org"&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;), for example, offers 1GB of RAM for applications, and it has offered session affinity for a few years. It didn&amp;rsquo;t offer session replication until late last year when a change to the buildpack enables session replication for any &lt;code&gt;.war&lt;/code&gt;-based web applications &lt;a href="http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/products/session-replication-on-cloud-foundry-2"&gt;deployed to the default, standalone configuration of the Apache Tomcat web server&lt;/a&gt;. This support doesn&amp;rsquo;t use multicast networking, though. Instead, it uses the convention of configuring any bound Redis backing-service for use with the Tomcat container&amp;rsquo;s session replication strategy. Using a backing-service like Redis, or perhaps some shared filesystem, are really the only sensible approaches to session replication in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these approaches have different tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some are container-specific and that implies they don&amp;rsquo;t move readily from one environment to another.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they may introduce additional complexity for operations (if you still have that team!) and that introduces just that much more friction between the application and production&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they may use mutlicast networking which doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well in a cloud environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they may rely on &lt;em&gt;magic&lt;/em&gt; like the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack which only knows about &lt;code&gt;.war&lt;/code&gt;s deployed to standalone Apache Tomcat, not embedded &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt;s or indeed other web containers like Jetty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an implied limitation to all of these other points is that the persistence strategy isn&amp;rsquo;t pluggable. Multicast isn&amp;rsquo;t for you? Great, use Redis. Redis isn&amp;rsquo;t for you and want to use Memcache or something else not readily supported? Oh&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#enter-spring-session" class="anchor" name="enter-spring-session"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Enter Spring Session&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Session provides a very nice solution for all of these problems. It&amp;rsquo;s a wrapper around the standard Servlet HTTP Session abstraction. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to plug in to any application, whether they&amp;rsquo;re Spring-based or not. It acts as a sort of proxy in front of the HTTP session that forwards requests to a strategy implementation. Out of the box, there&amp;rsquo;s an implementation that supports working with &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and another that works with Redis, directly. The implementation that uses a &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound all that interesting at first, but remember, all your favorite distributed data-grids (Pivotal GemFire, Hazelcast, Oracle Coherence, etc.) can give you a reference to a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; implementation backed by data-grid memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redis-specific implementation takes advantage of some efficiencies in Redis, if it&amp;rsquo;s available. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at setting up a dead-simple Spring Session application using Redis. Why Redis? Because it&amp;rsquo;s legitimately &amp;ldquo;web-scale&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/9/8/how-twitter-uses-redis-to-scale-105tb-ram-39mm-qps-10000-ins.html"&gt;check out this post on how Twitter uses it to scale to 105TB of RAM, 39MM QPS, and 10,000+ instances over on the &lt;em&gt;High Scalability&lt;/em&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get this example to work, I&amp;rsquo;ve added the following Maven dependencies to &lt;a href="http://start.spring.io"&gt;a simple Spring Boot project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;spring-boot-starter-redis&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;1.2.0.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	@RequestMapping(&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;)&#xD;
	String uid(HttpSession session) {&#xD;
		UUID uid = (UUID) session.getAttribute(&amp;quot;uid&amp;quot;);&#xD;
		if (uid == null) {&#xD;
			uid = UUID.randomUUID();&#xD;

	}&#xD;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you run it, make sure that you dedicate a clean Redis database to this application. You can, for example, reset the current database using &lt;code&gt;FLUSHDB&lt;/code&gt;. The Spring Boot Redis starter automatically connects to a Redis database running on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to point it somewhere specific, use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/redis/RedisProperties.java"&gt;various &lt;code&gt;spring.redis.*&lt;/code&gt; properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The example is as bare-minimum as possible: it simply confirms that data is being written to the Redis backing-store. Open up your &lt;code&gt;redis-cli&lt;/code&gt; utility after interacting with the web application at &lt;code&gt;localhost:8080/&lt;/code&gt; in your browser. The first request will trigger a unique session which will be used to cache the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; value. Subsequent requests by the same browser session will see the same value. Enter &lt;code&gt;keys *&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;redis-cli&lt;/code&gt; to see what&amp;rsquo;s been persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#deploying-to-cloudfoundry" class="anchor" name="deploying-to-cloudfoundry"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deploying to CloudFoundry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to this cloud can be a bit trickier. If you&amp;rsquo;re deploying this to Cloud Foundry, the Cloud Foundry buildpack will automatically replace the Spring Boot auto-configured &lt;code&gt;RedisConnectionFactory&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;RedisConnectionFactory&lt;/code&gt; that points to the Redis instance bound to the application. This works &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re running on Cloud Foundry, using the right buildpack, and don&amp;rsquo;t have more than one &lt;code&gt;RedisConnectionFactory&lt;/code&gt; in your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be using a Cloud Foundry &lt;code&gt;manifest.yml&lt;/code&gt; to describe how this application should look when deployed to Cloud Foundry. In this case, it&amp;rsquo;ll require at minimum a backing-service named &lt;code&gt;redis-session&lt;/code&gt; that supports a Redis database. I&amp;rsquo;ve put this file in the root of my project, next to my Maven &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this &lt;code&gt;manifest.yml&lt;/code&gt; contributes an environment variable, &lt;code&gt;SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE&lt;/code&gt;, that will activate the &lt;code&gt;cloud&lt;/code&gt; Spring profile. We&amp;rsquo;ll use this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint yml"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&#xD;
applications:&#xD;
- name: connectors&#xD;
  memory: 512M&#xD;
  instances: 1&#xD;
  host: connectors-${random-word}&#xD;
  domain: cfapps.io&#xD;
  path: target/connectors.jar&#xD;
  services:&#xD;
    - redis-session&#xD;
  env:&#xD;
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud&#xD;
    DEBUG: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&#xD;
    debug: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&#xD;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to create a Redis instance before pushing the application. I used the following incantation to create a simple Redis instance (called &lt;code&gt;redis-session&lt;/code&gt;, we reference it in the &lt;code&gt;manifest.yml&lt;/code&gt;) on Pivotal Web Services and then push the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint bash"&gt;cf create-service rediscloud  25mb redis-session&#xD;
cf push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can deploy the application as-is and things should just work in this example, with just one bound backing-service and one bean of a known type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the Spring Cloud PaaS connectors to make short work of explicitly configuring and consuming a cloud-managed Redis backing-service. In this new arrangement, we&amp;rsquo;ll use Spring profiles to keep configuration for running on Cloud Foundry explicit. Add Spring Cloud PaaS connectors like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;spring-boot-starter-cloud-connectors&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;1.2.0.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;ll make it so that Spring Boot will autowire instances of every bound backing-service type it knows about. If there&amp;rsquo;s a Redis database with a service ID &lt;code&gt;redis-session&lt;/code&gt; then it can be injected using regular Spring qualifiers, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint java"&gt;   // ..&#xD;
   @Autowired&#xD;
   @Qualifier(&amp;quot;redis-session&amp;quot;)&#xD;
   RedisConnectionFactory rcf;&#xD;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is the simplest, and that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll get if you simply add the Spring Cloud starter dependency. If you want to explicitly configure services, disable the Spring Boot starter by adding the following property to your Spring Boot &lt;code&gt;src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint properties"&gt;spring.cloud.enabled=false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, use the Spring Cloud PaaS connectors explicitly. The bean definition will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be active when the &lt;code&gt;cloud&lt;/code&gt; Spring profile is active. Otherwise, the Spring Boot auto-configuration will kick in (which is what you want when runnning locally).&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommending that you start cramming your HTTP session with JSF page graphs again! If you need an expiring, scalable, ephemeral-ish store for lightweight business state - like security tokens - then Spring Session can help. Since Spring Session sits between your application and the HTTP session, it can provide a few other useful abstractions above and beyond the Servlet &lt;code&gt;HttpSession&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href="http://spring.io/team/rwinch"&gt;Rob Winch, the lead of Spring Security and Spring Session&lt;/a&gt;, has done an amazing job talking about some of these other use cases in the documentation and in other blog posts, so I&amp;rsquo;ll just review here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can easily &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshlong/bootiful-sessions/tree/master/users"&gt;implement &amp;ldquo;Switch Users&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; functionality (sort of like Google Accounts). Check out the &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current/reference/html5/guides/users.html"&gt;amazing writeup in the docs for more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Session knows about your Spring websocket traffic and will correctly perpetuate the HTTP session. This avoids &lt;a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54738"&gt;the problems&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/WEBSOCKET_SPEC-175"&gt;the websocket standard&lt;/a&gt; where there&amp;rsquo;s no practical way to perpetuate the HTTP session from websocket traffic. Check out the &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current/reference/html5/guides/websocket.html"&gt;amazing writeup in the docs for more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can pull knobs and levers for everything, including the mechanism used to corellate client requests to server-side session state: &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshlong/bootiful-sessions/tree/master/rest"&gt;HTTP headers&lt;/a&gt;? Cookies? Something else? The headers approach is pretty darned cool and can give you a &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/01/20/the-resource-server-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-iii"&gt;sort of poor-man&amp;rsquo;s OAuth access token if used along with Spring Security&lt;/a&gt; to secure REST services. Check out the amazing &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current/reference/html5/guides/rest.html"&gt;writeup in the docs for more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to do a webinar on Spring Session last week. &lt;a href="http://spring.io/team/rwinch"&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; gave me the 411 on some things that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be in future releases: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;session concurrency control (&amp;ldquo;sign me out of my other accounts&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Batch and Spring Integration claim-check support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support for managing accounts - optimized persistence (beyond Java serialization),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;smarter, injectable beans (as opposed to beans that are exposed as well-known request attributes but could otherwise be made available as Spring MVC arguments or the like)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Rob, for all the great information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another installment of &lt;em&gt;This Week in Spring&lt;/em&gt;! We&amp;rsquo;ve got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to cover so let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our pal Adam Koblentz (from ZeroTurnaround) put up this &lt;a href="https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2015/02/no-snail-herding-websocket-addition-jrebel-spring-boot/"&gt;great post introducing building a websocket application with Spring Boot and JRebel&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out this replay of Mark Fisher, Dr. Mark Pollack, and Sabby Anandan&amp;rsquo;s webinar &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/02/20/webinar-replay-spring-xd-a-platform-for-data-at-scale-and-developer-productivity"&gt;introducing Spring XD - A Platform for data at scale and developer productivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A huge part of the Pivotal Data Suite, of course, is Spring XD. Last week I surfaced some of the amazing Spring XD wiki content on &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2015/02/20/stream-processing-in-spring-xd-1-1"&gt;the new stream processing supports in Spring XD 1.1&lt;/a&gt;. Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-a-Data-Stream-Processor-Module#reactor-streams"&gt;the Wiki page&lt;/a&gt; for a more detailed look by Spring XD ninja Ilayaperumal Gopinathan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Cloud co-lead Spencer Gibb has been improving the Spring Cloud Netflix integration. Check out this example &lt;a href="https://github.com/spencergibb/myfeed/blob/master/myfeed-ui/src/main/java/myfeed/ui/UiController.java#L38-L57"&gt;demonstrating using RxJava&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Observable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; return-values from Spring MVC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://github.com/spencergibb/myfeed/commit/a301aba6139fce7a87a1aab1d1311e6ceb8adfb7"&gt;Here are the changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;March Webinars are here, and it&amp;rsquo;s packed with Javascript, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.&lt;br/&gt;This killer lineup starts with Dr. Dave Syer&amp;rsquo;s epic VII part blog series on Angular - lightweight API gateway - Spring Security - made into a &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/24/webinar-a-single-page-application-with-spring-security-and-angular-js"&gt;webinar on March 10th&lt;/a&gt;. Then Scott Deeg will examine the same thing, except with Google&amp;rsquo;s Polymer on the frontend, &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/24/webinar-building-a-secure-polymer-app-with-spring-backend"&gt;on a webinar March 24th&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, Julien Dubois will introduce the AngularJS+Boot application generator, JHipster on &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/24/webinar-jhipster-for-spring-boot"&gt;March 17th, 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alvin Reyes&amp;rsquo;s posts introducing how to configure Apache Tomcat&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/tomcat/tomcat-server-xml-configuration-example/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;server.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/tomcat/tomcat-users-xml-configuration-example"&gt;&lt;code&gt;users.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; resources.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polymer is the latest web framework out of Google. Designed completely around the emerging Web Components standards, it has the lofty goal of making it easy to build apps based on these low level primitives. Along with Polymer comes a new set of Elements (buttons, dialog boxes and such) based on the ideas of &amp;quot;Material Design&amp;quot;. These technologies together make it easy to build responsive, componentized &amp;quot;Single Page&amp;quot; web applications that work for browsers on PCs or mobile devices. But what about the backend, and how do we make these apps secure? In this talk Scott Deeg will take you through an introduction to Polmyer and its related technologies, and then through the build out of a full blown cloud based app with a secure, RESTful backend based on Spring REST, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security and using Thymeleaf for backend rendering jobs. At the end he will show the principles applied in a tool he's currently building. The talk will be mainly code walk through and demo, and assumes familiarity with Java/Spring and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 24th, 2015 2:00PM GMT (London GMT) &lt;a href="http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_7AMBuildingasecurePolymerappwithSpringbackend_Register.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 24th, 2015 10:00AM PDT (San Francisco GMT-07:00) &lt;a href="http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_10AMBuildingasecurePolymerappwithSpringbackend_Register.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;JHipster focuses on generating a high quality application with a Java back-end using an extensive set of Spring technologies; Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring MVC (providing a framework for websockets, REST and MVC), etc. an Angular.js front-end and a suite of pre-configured development tools like Yeoman, Maven, Gradle, Grunt, Gulp.js and Bower. JHipster creates a fully configured Spring Boot application with a set of pre-defined screens for user management, monitoring, and logging. The generated Spring Boot application is specifically tailored to make working with Angular.js a smoother experience. Join Julien for a quick-live coding session to build a simple application, and deploy it to Cloud Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 17th, 2015 2:00PM GMT (London GMT) &lt;a href="http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_7AMJHipster_Register.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 17th, 2015 10:00AM PDT (San Francisco GMT-07:00) &lt;a href="http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_10AMJHipster_Register.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt; Pivotal Spring Security, Spring Boot and Angular JS all have nice features for making it really easy to produce modern applications, so there is potentially a lot of value in making them work together very smoothly. Things to consider are cookies, headers, native clients, various security vulnerabilities and how modern browser technology can help us to avoid them. In this session we show how nice features of the component frameworks can be integrated simply to provide a pleasant and secure user experience. We start with a very basic single-server implementation and scale it up in stages, splitting out backend resources and authentication to separate services. The final state includes a simple API Gateway on the front end implemented declaratively using Spring Cloud, and using this we are able to neatly sidestep a lot of the problems people encounter securing a javascript front end with a distributed back end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 10th, 2015 2:00PM GMT (London GMT)&lt;a href="http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_7AMSinglePageApp-SpringSecurity-AngularJS_Register.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 10th, 2015 10:00AM PDT (San Francisco GMT-07:00) &lt;a href="http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_10AMSinglePageApp-SpringSecurity-AngularJS_Register.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Spring Data REST bridges the gap between the convenient data access layers provided by Spring Data's repository abstraction and hypermedia-driven REST web services, effectively taking out the boilerplate needed during implementation. This talk will give a quick overview of the project, explain fundamental design decisions and introduce new features of the latest version (namely service documentation and discoverability). We will then look at the Spring-A-Gram sample application (built using Spring Data REST), focusing on the implementation of the frontend bits and pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation we will examine various scalability options in order to improve the robustness and performance of your Spring Batch applications. We start out with a single threaded Spring Batch application that we will refactor so we can demonstrate how to run it using: * Concurrent Steps * Remote Chunking * AsyncItemProcessor and AsyncItemWriter * Remote Partitioning Additionally, we will show how you can deploy Spring Batch applications to Spring XD which provides high availability and failover capabilities. Spring XD also allows you to integrate Spring Batch applications with other Big Data processing needs.&lt;a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core Spring Track &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Panel session, each of these presenters will have 20 minutes to respond to the question: tell us about your experiences with Spring Boot? Following that is about 30 minutes of moderated panel discussion. Erdem Gunay from Turkcell will present his experience of re-writing a Mobile BaaS originally written with Spring 3.x. He wrote the service from scratch using Boot in one week, integrating spring security, elasticsearch, mongodb, camel, angular.js, for the win: 40x throughput, 100% availability - zero crashes, 3x the users - used on 300k mobile devices. Tim Hobson from Intuit will present his lessons learned from using with Boot - he will take you through what configuration was necessary, what needed to be built, and how the project leveraged Boot to minimize cross-cutting code and configuration, maximize testability, and focus on the application domain. Zach will present a view of Boot from the hospitality industry, where they are using JAX-RS, DropWizard, and Spring Boot to create micro-service applications. He will help you understand which dropwizard-spring integrations work, and which one's don't, what to watch out for, and how to integrate your Spring applications into dropwizard whether you configure your Spring applications with xml, annotations, and/or java config files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will show, how easy it is to get started with Spring Data Neo4j using Spring Boot. After a quick introduction of the concepts behind the Neo4j NoSQL graph database and its Spring Data integration library, we will discuss the general approach used in Spring Data Neo4j and highlight the exciting, new features of the new 3.x releases which now works with the most recent Neo4j 2.x versions. During the session we'll demonstrate the development steps of an exciting and unusual application - tracking an famous' artists journey connecting him to the places, paintings, people and other aspects that influenced him. Having this data in a graph allows us to find new insights and conclusions as well as quickly adding different aspects to it. This application will use Spring Boot and Spring Data Neo4j to get started quickly. We import the data, look at it as a graph visualization and then build a web-application using Spring Boot's supporting infrastructure. As a final step we show how evolving this application from being a just Neo4j client application to a REST extension of the Neo4j server requires only a few steps and can leverage Spring Data REST to provide the neccessary endpoints for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maven&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html"&gt;dependency management&lt;/a&gt; includes the concept of a bill-of-materials (bom). A bom is a special kind of pom that is used to control the versions of a project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies and provides a central place to define and update those versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of Spring projects including Spring Framework, Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, and the Spring IO Platform provide boms to make things easier for Maven users. Unfortunately, things haven&amp;rsquo;t been quite so easy if you&amp;rsquo;re using Gradle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#dependency-management-in-gradle" class="anchor" name="dependency-management-in-gradle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dependency management in Gradle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/dependency_management.html"&gt;Gradle&amp;rsquo;s dependency management&lt;/a&gt; uses a &lt;a href="https://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ResolutionStrategy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to take control of a project&amp;rsquo;s dependency versions. This offers a lot of power and flexibility but doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a way to reuse the dependency management that&amp;rsquo;s already been declared in a Maven bom. As a result, you have to do so manually. Depending on the bom, this can easily equate to tens of additional lines in your &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; script just to reuse some existing configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#reusing-a-bom-in-gradle" class="anchor" name="reusing-a-bom-in-gradle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reusing a bom in Gradle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Gradle&amp;rsquo;s key strengths is that it can be easily extended and its behaviour customized through the use of plugins. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken advantage of this and written a &lt;a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.spring.dependency-management"&gt;dependency management plugin for Gradle&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s compatible with both Gradle 1.x and 2.x. This plugin allows you to use a Maven bom to control your build&amp;rsquo;s dependencies in a handful of lines. The first step is to apply the plugin. In Gradle 2.1 and later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint groovy"&gt;plugins {&#xD;
  id &amp;quot;io.spring.dependency-management&amp;quot; version &amp;quot;0.4.0.RELEASE&amp;quot;&#xD;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earlier versions of Gradle it&amp;rsquo;s a little more verbose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint groovy"&gt;buildscript {&#xD;
  repositories {&#xD;
    jcenter()&#xD;
  }&#xD;
  dependencies {&#xD;
    classpath &amp;quot;io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:0.4.0.RELEASE&amp;quot;&#xD;
  }&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
apply plugin: &amp;quot;io.spring.dependency-management&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the plugin&amp;rsquo;s been applied you can use it to import a Maven bom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint groovy"&gt;dependencyManagement {&#xD;
  imports {&#xD;
    mavenBom &amp;#39;io.spring.platform:platform-bom:1.1.1.RELEASE&amp;#39;&#xD;
  }&#xD;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this configuration in place you can declare dependencies on anything in the bom without specifying a version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint groovy"&gt;dependencies {&#xD;
    compile &amp;#39;org.springframework:spring-core&amp;#39;&#xD;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imported bom will control the version of the dependency. It will also control the version of its transitive dependencies if they&amp;rsquo;re listed in the bom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#exclusions-in-gradle" class="anchor" name="exclusions-in-gradle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exclusions in Gradle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradle can retrieve dependencies from a Maven repository and it uses the metadata in Maven pom files to do so. However, rather than obeying Maven&amp;rsquo;s rules, it applies its own, subtly different semantics to the metadata. One area where this can cause problems is with the exclusion of transitive dependencies. This is best illustrated with a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a module that depends on a couple of Spring Framework modules,&lt;code&gt;spring-core&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spring-beans&lt;/code&gt;, and that uses SLF4J rather than Commons Logging. The dependencies in its pom would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint xml"&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spring-core&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;4.1.4.RELEASE&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;exclusions&amp;gt;&#xD;
    &amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt;&#xD;
      &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;commons-logging&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&#xD;
      &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;commons-logging&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&#xD;
    &amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;/exclusions&amp;gt;&#xD;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&#xD;
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spring-beans&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;4.1.4.RELEASE&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&#xD;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&#xD;
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.slf4j&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;jcl-over-slf4j&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&#xD;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.7.10&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&#xD;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a Maven build depends on this module its dependency tree will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint"&gt;\- com.example:my-library:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:compile&#xD;
   +- org.springframework:spring-core:jar:4.1.4.RELEASE:compile&#xD;
   +- org.springframework:spring-beans:jar:4.1.4.RELEASE:compile&#xD;
   \- org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j:jar:1.7.10:compile&#xD;
      \- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.7.10:compile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;commons-logging&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t listed as the only module that depends upon it is &lt;code&gt;spring-core&lt;/code&gt; where it has been excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dependency tree of the equivalent Gradle build looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint"&gt;\--- com.example:my-library:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&#xD;
     +--- org.springframework:spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE&#xD;
     |    \--- commons-logging:commons-logging:1.2&#xD;
     +--- org.springframework:spring-beans:4.1.4.RELEASE&#xD;
     |    \--- org.springframework:spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE (*)&#xD;
     \--- org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j:1.7.10&#xD;
          \--- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the exclusion, &lt;code&gt;commons-logging&lt;/code&gt; is listed this time. This can be problematic as it leaves your classpath polluted with dependencies that should not be there. You can work around the problem by manually configuring the required exclusions in your Gradle build, but first of all you have to know what the exclusions should be, and then you have to go through the tedious and error-prone process of configuring them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#honoring-a-pom-rsquo-s-exclusions" class="anchor" name="honoring-a-pom-rsquo-s-exclusions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Honoring a pom&amp;rsquo;s exclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dependency management plugin changes Gradle&amp;rsquo;s handling of a pom&amp;rsquo;s exclusions so that they behave as they do in Maven. With the plugin applied to the example project, it no longer pulls in &lt;code&gt;commons-logging&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint"&gt;\--- com.example:my-library:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&#xD;
     +--- org.springframework:spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE&#xD;
     +--- org.springframework:spring-beans:4.1.4.RELEASE&#xD;
     |    \--- org.springframework:spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE&#xD;
     \--- org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j:1.7.10&#xD;
          \--- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#using-the-plugin-with-spring-boot" class="anchor" name="using-the-plugin-with-spring-boot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using the plugin with Spring Boot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some similarities between this plugin and Spring Boot&amp;rsquo;s Gradle plugin. For example, the Spring Boot plugin also &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins-gradle-dependencies-without-versions"&gt;allows dependencies to be declared without a version&lt;/a&gt;, however it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect transitive dependencies and doesn&amp;rsquo;t honor Maven exclusions. In Spring Boot 1.3 we intend to &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2133"&gt;remove Boot&amp;rsquo;s own dependency management and to start using the dependency management plugin instead&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the two plugins will happily co-exist and you can configure the dependency management plugin to use Spring Boot&amp;rsquo;s starter bom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint groovy"&gt;buildscript {&#xD;
  repositories {&#xD;
    jcenter()&#xD;
  }&#xD;
  dependencies {&#xD;
    classpath &amp;quot;io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:0.4.0.RELEASE&amp;quot;&#xD;
    classpath &amp;quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.2.1.RELEASE&amp;quot;&#xD;
  }&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
apply plugin: &amp;quot;io.spring.dependency-management&amp;quot;&#xD;
apply plugin: &amp;quot;spring-boot&amp;quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
repositories {&#xD;
  jcenter()&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
dependencyManagement {&#xD;
  imports {&#xD;
    mavenBom &amp;#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent:1.2.1.RELEASE&amp;#39;&#xD;
  }&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
dependencies {&#xD;
  compile &amp;quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web&amp;quot;&#xD;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#learning-more" class="anchor" name="learning-more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Learning more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the features described above, the plugin has support for working with a bom&amp;rsquo;s properties (both overriding them and using them in your Gradle build), automatically including dependency management metadata in Gradle-generated pom files, and more. Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin/blob/master/README.md"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plugin is Apache-licensed and is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. GitHub&amp;rsquo;s also used for &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin/issues"&gt;issue tracking&lt;/a&gt;.

    <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tip is drawn heavily from this Wiki-page on &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-a-Data-Stream-Processor-Module#reactor-streams"&gt;Spring XD&amp;rsquo;s streaming support&lt;/a&gt; by various Spring XD team-members, and particularly the amazing &lt;a href="https://github.com/ilayaperumalg"&gt;Ilayaperumal Gopinathan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring XD 1.1 is here and is &lt;em&gt;packed&lt;/em&gt; with lots of new features. One theme for this release is rich stream processing support. Spring XD 1.1 provides integration with &lt;a href="https://github.com/reactor"&gt;Project Reactor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor/blob/master/reactor-core/src/main/java/reactor/rx/Stream.java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/"&gt;RxJava&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Observable"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/"&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s streaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look specifically at using Reactor, though the concepts are similar across all of the supported streaming APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messages that are delivered on the Message Bus are accessed from the input Stream. The return value is the output Stream that is the result of applying various operations to the input stream. The content of the output Stream is sent to the message bus for consumption by other processors or sinks. To implement a &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt;-based processor module you need to implement the interface &lt;code&gt;org.springframework.xd.reactor.Processor&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="prettyprint java"&gt;import org.springframework.xd.reactor.Processor;&#xD;
import org.springframework.xd.tuple.Tuple;&#xD;
import reactor.rx.Stream;&#xD;
&#xD;
import static com.acme.Math.avg;&#xD;
import static org.springframework.xd.tuple.TupleBuilder.tuple;&#xD;
&#xD;
public class MovingAverage implements Processor&amp;lt;Tuple, Tuple&amp;gt; {&#xD;
&#xD;
  @Override&#xD;
  public Stream&amp;lt;Tuple&amp;gt; process(Stream&amp;lt;Tuple&amp;gt; inputStream) {&#xD;
    return inputStream.map(tuple -&amp;gt; tuple.getDouble(&amp;quot;measurement&amp;quot;))&#xD;
      .buffer(5)&#xD;
      .map(data -&amp;gt; tuple().of(&amp;quot;average&amp;quot;, avg(data)));&#xD;
  }&#xD;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a test for this is as simple as setting up a Spring Integration flow that takes input on a request channel and routes it to this processor via a &lt;code&gt;org.springframework.xd.reactor.SynchronousDispatcherMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt; component which itself writes its output to an output channel. From there, you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Modules#module-packaging"&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-a-Processor-Module#register-the-module"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; the custom processor in the Spring XD admin server.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
